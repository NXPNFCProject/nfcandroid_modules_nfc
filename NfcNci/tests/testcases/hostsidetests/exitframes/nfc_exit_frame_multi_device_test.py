"""
This test suite is intended to be run on devices that support the exit frame
capability added in Android 16. The tests set the exit frame table, then use a
PN532 or Casimir to send polling frames to the device under test.

The tests are currently very basic. They do not test that the device under test
actually supports exit frames, and it's possible these tests can pass with the
NFC stack's autotransact implementation. Device logs should be used to verify
observe mode was actually disabled at the firmware level.
